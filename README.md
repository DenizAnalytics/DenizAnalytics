I am an experienced IT support technician with a background in Netflix Customer Service, currently seeking a full-time role in Information Technology. I hold two major certificates in IT support and data analytics from Google, as well as three up-to-date certificates from Microsoft in Azure (AZ-900), Microsoft 365 (MS-900), and Dynamics 365 CRM (MB-910). I have a strong affinity for Microsoft Azure Cloud and also possess foundational experience in Google Cloud.

My skill set includes troubleshooting, customer service, networking, system administration, and data analysis. My up-to-date skills provide me with a significant advantage in collaborating with IT teams, DevOps professionals, and software developers, and my ability to adapt easily to new technologies. Additionally, my project management skills make me well-suited for Agile and Scrum methodologies.

I am ready to apply my comprehensive skill set and certifications to drive technical excellence in a new role.
